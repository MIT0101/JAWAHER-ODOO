Product Price Restriction In POS
================================
The "Product Price Restriction in POS" module is designed to enforce strict access controls over price adjustments in your Odoo Point of Sale system. With this module, you can designate specific user roles who are authorized to change product prices while preventing unauthorized users from making any modifications. User permissions are managed at a granular level, ensuring that only designated personnel have the ability to override price restrictions. Even authorized users are subject to real-time validation, guaranteeing adherence to pricing policies. Comprehensive logs and customizable alerts provide transparency and accountability, while integration with Odoo's security features ensures a secure and streamlined access control process. This module is ideal for businesses that require strict price control in their POS system, enabling them to maintain pricing integrity and security.

After installation, go to your settings. Click on "Users & Companies," and then select "Users."

Choose a specific user you want to configure. In that user's profile, click on "Access Rights," and scroll down (Make sure you have developer mode turned on). You'll see a checkbox named "Product Price Restriction In POS." Check this box and save your changes.

Log out from the admin account and log in with the specific user's account you just configured. Open the POS app, start a new session.

Add some products. If the user tries to change the product price, they won't be able to because the price is restricted for that user after installing this Odoo module.
